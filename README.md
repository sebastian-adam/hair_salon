Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:
Use of standard naming conventions for database tables and columns.
Correct set up of a one-to-many relationship.
Execution of CRUD functionality in class methods and routes.
Use of RESTful routes.
All previous code standards met. (Except you are not required to deploy to Heroku this week.)
Discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology.
